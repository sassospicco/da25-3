\section{The assignment}

The assignment asked to implement a randomized byzantine agreement algorihtm on a distributed system.
This algorithm is designed to give a distributed system where some processes may be faulty a way of reaching consensus without taking indefinitely long.
Also because of the randomized component, the algorithm can run on asynchronous systems as well as synchoronous systems.
To hold on to this promises the algorihtm does assume the number of faulty processes is lower than one fifth of the total number of processes.
