\section{The assignment}

The assignment asked to implement a Randomized Byzantine Agreement algorithm on a distributed system.
This algorithm is designed to give a distributed system, where some processes may be faulty, a way of reaching consensus without taking indefinitely long.
Also because of the randomized component, the algorithm can run on asynchronous systems as well as synchronous systems.
To hold on to this promises the number of faulty processes has to be lower than one fifth of the total number of processes. 
In the next sections we will show our implementation is correct by subjecting it to different tests.
